# MODULE 0x000 LECTURE 0x010 - Pentesting Models


## The Flaw Hypothesis Model

* Thesis: "In absence of more formal correctness proof techniques, pentests are the most cost-effective method for assessing vulnerabilities"
    - presented by Richard R. Linde

Four stages:
1. Knowledge of system control structure
    - Pentest analysts must understand how users interact with the system
    - Read system  manuals, study literatre concerning system flaws, etc.
2. Flaw hypothesis generation
    - Record probable flaws
3. Flaw hypothesis confirmation
    - Carry out live tests of suspected flaws
    - Demonstrate their existence
4. Flaw hypothesis generalization
    - Deliniate generic weaknesses that can occur in similar scenarios
    - Outline possible remediations

## OSSTM-3.0 (Open Source Securiy Manual)

TL;DR:

Track:
    - What you test, i.e. targets
    - How you test them
    - Types of control discovered
    - What you didn't test
    - Security Test Audit Report (STAR report)

* OSSTM outlines the cross-disciplinary requirements for pentesting
    - Security
    - Law
    - Business Issues
    - Process technology


## Attack Framework: Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain (TM)

A framework provides more structure than a model, allowing to specify instances of each model element

* Based on analysis of adversary campaigns

They say conventional incident response methods fail to mitigate risk by threat actors because of two flawed assumptions:
1. Response should happen after the point of compromise
2. The compromise was the result of a fixable flaw.

**Elements of Cyber Kill Chain:**

* Indicators of intrusion
    - Atomic (IPs, email addresses...)
    - Computed (hash values, regex matches...)
    - Behavioral (sequence of actions taken by attacker)
* Kill Chain Phases:
    - Reconnaisance
    - Weaponization
    - Delivery
    - Exploitation
    - Installation
    - Command & control
    - Action objectives

## Attack Framework: MITRE ATT&CK FRAMEWORK (TM)

Structured approach to describing the ways adversaries attack computer systems

* Very detailed, curated technical info that can be applied in many ways
* Describes methods of attack, detection, mitigation
* Can be used to evaluate and improve an enterprise's security posture

Built in three parts ("TTP"s)
1. Tactics
    - TA0043: Reconnaisance
    - TA0042: Resource Development
    - TA0001: Initial Access
    - TA0002: Execution
    - TA0003: Persistence
    - TA0004: Privesc
    - TA0005: Defense evasion
    - TA0006: Credential access
    - TA0007: Discovery
    - TA0008: Lateral movement
    - TA0009: Collection
    - TA0011: Command & control
    - TA0010: Exfiltration
    - TA0040: Impact (misc. stuff, e.g. deletion of data)
2. Techniques
3. Procedures
