## Practical Assignments

These simulate activities that could form or be an actual penetration test.
    - Randomly assigned teams of three.
    - Students complete most of these problems to whatever level of ocmpletion they're comfortable
    - Then. each individual student will -- perhaps re-do the problem -- write a partial pentest report using the LaTeX template.
    - The report verifies what you completed (vulnerabilities, exploits, etc.)


## Final exams

* 55 questions
    - Equally weighted (do easy ones first)
    - Various keys are available during the semester. Identify them, and decrypt the contained message for a phrase that provides leeway credit on final exam
