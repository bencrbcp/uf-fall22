# MODULE 0x010 LECTURE 0x040 - Pentesting Ethics

## Perception of pentesters

"borderline illegal, evil, legal criminals, etc."

To avoid these perceptions, SySS suggests 10 concepts:
1) Independence (from client; aka don't be the tester for the security which you set up yourself). Also, don't test clients who you sell to.
2) Prohibition on commission fees
3) Care (for customer... let them know risks, negative outcomes, threats, interruption of services)
4) Professionalism & QA
5) Contractual adherance
6) Impartiality, neutrality, and transparency
7) Conflicts of interest (should be avoided and reported)
8) Strict obedience of law
9) Respect for human beings
10) Correct Attribution

## Sample reports

* Hard to find online (who would want to disclose their vulns online)
    - OSCP has samples, but they're more focused on the attack narrative than client needs
* References to NIST SP 800-115
    - Upon completion of analysis, a report should be generated that identifies system, network, and organizatoinal vulns + recommended mitigations.


## Template (LaTeX)

* Can be found in the class directory on my laptop, or on Wilson's website
