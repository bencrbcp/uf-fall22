WHAT I GATHERED:

- The first key was "This is the key."
- Angecryption is used, meaning that the first key is also the first ciphertext.
- Using the provided IV and "This is the key." as both the key and the ciphertext, we are able to get the first plaintext: "Glad you got it!"

AFTER GETTING FIRST KEY:

- From Dr. Wilson: You must base64 decode the other keys and concatenate them (in order) to key0.
