## Polyadic Number Systems

The representation of a number through digit sequence, _to a certain base._

These include: Binary numbers (B=2), Octal (B=8), Decimal (B=10), Hexadecimal (B=16)

**Theorem:** A number in {0,1,...,B^n -1} has exactly one n-digit representation


## Non Polyadic Number Systems

e.g. Roman numerals
    - Additive system
    - No digit representation
    - Not quite as systematic as polyadic


## Optimal Base (in polyadic number systems)

**Precision:** Z = B^n = set of all numbers that can be represented {00..0, 00..1, 00..B-1, 00..10, ...}

```
Cost E = B n
```

_The optimal base is 3._ (Look at powerpoint for caluclation)
    - The binary system is preferred over tertiary because of its easier way to represent (on and off... high and low voltage)
