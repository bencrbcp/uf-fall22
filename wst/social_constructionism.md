## Theories behind social constrctionism

**Critical theory:** A challenge of the dominant discourse typically spearheaded by marginalized groups (feminists, BIPOC, differently abled communities, etc.)

**Literary theory:** Posits language as the driving factor in the construction of categories.
    - Every form of description we use assert its own reality over what we want to describe.

**Social theory:** Whatever scientists do will manifest out of the enclave they exist.
    - The scientific observer is a part of a community and will use the traditions of that community to create that study.
    - They operate on a similar methodology, a similar language, how to write about it, how to use statistics.
