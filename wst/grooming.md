# Grooming

* What is grooming?
    - The action by a pedophile of preparing a child to be sexually assaulted and not tell another adult about it

* "Grooming" is also becoming an incendiary buzzword of right-wing rhetoric, weaponized in the fight of anti-LGBQT legislation
    - Long history of this
    - In 1978, a failed California ballot measure tried to ban gays and lesbians from working in public schools in order to "restore molarity to the classroom and remove openly blatant homosexuals from influencing teachers and our young."

* HBN1557
    - "Don't say gay"
    - Prohibits any instruction in elementary schools of gender identity and sexual orientation

* "THEYRE TEACHING KIDS ABOUT SEX"
    - Claims are that
    -teaching kids about sex  Data shows that not exposing kids to these ideas, it leaves them unprepared for potential abuse situations

* "Homosexuality among pedophiles"
    - It's often NOT about homesexuality/bisexuality/other forms of sexual attraction.
    - It's often time more about WHO THE ABUSER HAS ACCESS TO.
